        <em>Abstract</em> — The control of co-axial rotored drones presents
        unique challenges due to their complex dynamics and nonlinear nature. In
        this paper, we present a geometric control approach for co-axial drones,
        leveraging the drone's spatial dynamics and state representation
        introduced in our previous work. The proposed controller design aims to
        achieve precise trajectory tracking and robust performance in the
        presence of disturbances. We formulate the control problem in the
        geometric framework, utilizing the drone's configuration manifold and
        associated tangent spaces. The control law is derived using Lyapunov
        stability analysis, ensuring asymptotic convergence of the tracking
        errors. The controller structure is composed of a cascaded architecture,
        with an outer loop for position control and an inner loop for attitude
        control. The control inputs are mapped to the rotor speeds using the
        drone's actuation matrix, taking into account the thrust and moment
        generation of the co-axial rotors. Simulation results demonstrate the
        effectiveness of the proposed geometric controller in tracking desired
        trajectories and rejecting disturbances. The controller exhibits
        excellent tracking performance and robustness, even in the presence of
        model uncertainties and external perturbations. The geometric control
        approach provides a principled and intuitive framework for the control
        of co-axial drones, enabling agile and precise maneuvering in complex
        environments. This work contributes to the advancement of autonomous
        aerial robotics and opens up new possibilities for the deployment of
        co-axial drones in various applications, such as inspection,
        surveillance, and transportation.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The control of co-axial rotored drones is a challenging problem due to
        their inherent nonlinearities and underactuation. Traditional control
        approaches often struggle to achieve precise trajectory tracking and
        robust performance in the presence of disturbances. In this paper, we
        propose a geometric control approach that leverages the drone's spatial
        dynamics and state representation to design a controller that achieves
        excellent tracking performance and robustness. The geometric control
        framework provides a principled and intuitive way to handle the
        nonlinearities and coupling in the drone's dynamics, enabling agile and
        precise maneuvering in complex environments.

    <h1>Control Design</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Problem Formulation</h2>
      <p>
        The control objective is to design a feedback control law that enables
        the co-axial drone to track a desired trajectory while rejecting
        disturbances. Let \(\mathbf{p}^d_W(t)\), \(\mathbf{v}^d_W(t)\),
        \(\mathbf{a}^d_W(t)\) denote the desired position, velocity, and
        acceleration in the world frame, and \(\boldsymbol{\omega}^d_B(t)\),
        \(\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^d_B(t)\) denote the desired angular velocity
        and acceleration in the body frame. The control problem is formulated as
        the minimization of the tracking errors:
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \mathbf{e}_p(t) = \mathbf{p}_W(t) - \mathbf{p}^d_W(t)
        \]
        \[  
          \mathbf{e}_v(t) = \mathbf{v}_W(t) - \mathbf{v}^d_W(t)
        \]
        \[
          \mathbf{e}_R(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{R}^{dT}_W(t)\mathbf{R}^B_W(t) - \mathbf{R}^{BT}_W(t)\mathbf{R}^d_W(t)\right)^\vee
        \]
        \[
          \mathbf{e}_\omega(t) = \boldsymbol{\omega}_B(t) - \mathbf{R}^{BT}_W(t)\mathbf{R}^d_W(t)\boldsymbol{\omega}^d_B(t)
        \]
      </div>

      <h2>Control Law</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed geometric controller consists of an outer loop for position
        control and an inner loop for attitude control. The control law is
        derived using Lyapunov stability analysis, ensuring asymptotic
        convergence of the tracking errors.
      </p>

      <h3>Position Control</h3>
      <p>
        The desired force in the world frame, \(\mathbf{f}^d_W\), is computed
        based on the position and velocity errors:
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \mathbf{f}^d_W = -k_p\mathbf{e}_p - k_v\mathbf{e}_v + m\mathbf{g} + m\mathbf{a}^d_W
        \]
      </div>
      <p>
        where \(k_p\) and \(k_v\) are positive gains, \(m\) is the drone's mass,
        and \(\mathbf{g}\) is the gravitational acceleration vector.
      </p>

      <h3>Attitude Control</h3>
      <p>
        The desired orientation, \(\mathbf{R}^d_W\), is computed based on the
        desired force and a desired yaw angle, \(\psi^d\):
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \mathbf{x}^d_W = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\psi^d & 0 & \sin\psi^d \end{bmatrix}^T
        \qquad
          \mathbf{y}^d_W = \frac{\mathbf{f}^d_W \times \mathbf{x}^d_W}{\|\mathbf{f}^d_W \times \mathbf{x}^d_W\|}
        \]
        \[  
          \mathbf{z}^d_W = \frac{\mathbf{f}^d_W}{\|\mathbf{f}^d_W\|}
          \qquad
          \mathbf{R}^d_W = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{y}^d_W & \mathbf{z}^d_W & \mathbf{x}^d_W \end{bmatrix}
        \]
      </div>
      <p>
        The desired control torque in the body frame, \(\boldsymbol{\tau}^d_B\),
        is computed based on the attitude and angular velocity errors:
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \boldsymbol{\tau}^d_B = -k_R\mathbf{e}_R - k_\omega\mathbf{e}_\omega + \boldsymbol{\omega}_B \times \mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega}_B - \mathbf{I}\left(\mathbf{R}^{BT}_W\mathbf{R}^d_W\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^d_B - \boldsymbol{\omega}_B \times \mathbf{R}^{BT}_W\mathbf{R}^d_W\boldsymbol{\omega}^d_B\right)
        \]
      </div>
      <p>
        where \(k_R\) and \(k_\omega\) are positive gains, and \(\mathbf{I}\) is
        the drone's inertia matrix.
      </p>

      <h2>Rotor Speed Mapping</h2>
      <p>
        The control inputs, \(f^d_B\) and \(\boldsymbol{\tau}^d_B\), are mapped
        to the rotor speeds, \(\omega_i\), using the drone's actuation matrix,
        \(\mathbf{F}\):
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <div class="equation">
        \[
          \begin{bmatrix} f^d_B \\ \boldsymbol{\tau}^d_B \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{F} \begin{bmatrix} \omega^2_1 \\ \omega^2_2 \\ \omega^2_3 \\ \omega^2_4 \end{bmatrix}
        \]
      </div>
      <p>
        The actuation matrix, \(\mathbf{F}\), is derived based on the thrust and
        moment generation of the co-axial rotors, considering the rotor
        configuration and aerodynamic coefficients.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>Simulation Results</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The proposed geometric controller is implemented and tested in
        simulation using the co-axial drone model developed in our previous
        work. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
        controller in tracking desired trajectories and rejecting disturbances.

        The controller exhibits excellent tracking performance, closely
        following the desired position and orientation trajectories. The
        tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically, indicating the
        stability and convergence properties of the control law.

      <p>
        The controller also demonstrates robust performance in the presence of
        disturbances. When subjected to external perturbations, the controller
        effectively rejects the disturbances and maintains stable tracking of
        the desired trajectory.
