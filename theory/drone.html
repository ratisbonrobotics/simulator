    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        This paper explores the simulation of drone dynamics in both 2D and 3D
        perspectives, emphasizing the importance of precise simulation for
        optimizing drone flight parameters including efficiency, agility, and
        stability. It proposes a comprehensive framework for simulating
        realistic drone behaviors and assessing the influence of design
        modifications and environmental factors on flight performance.

    <h1>Two-Dimensional Simulation</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>State Representation</h2>
      <p>
        A simulation is considered comprehensive if it can predict the drone's
        state \(X\) for subsequent discrete time intervals.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X = [x, y, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}] \)
      </div>
      <p>
        Here, \(X\) encapsulates the drone's coordinates (\(x, y\)), rotational
        angle (\(\phi\)) about the x-axis, and their corresponding velocities
        (\(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\)). The thrust forces (\(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\)) from the rotors, combined with environmental factors, result
        in the alteration of the state vector \(X\). The thrusts \(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\) are angled relative to the y-axis by \(\phi\).

      <h2>Dynamics Formulation</h2>
      <p>
        The dynamics of the drone are characterized by how its state \(X\)
        evolves under the influence of forces \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\). These
        forces, as a function of rotor velocities (\(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}\)),
        follow a quadratic relationship with thrust (denoted by \(k_{f}\)), a
        principle grounded in the laws of motion developed by Newton in the 17th
        century.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">\( F_{i} = k_{f} \omega_{i}^2 \)</div>
      <p>
        Changes in the drone's position (\(x, y, \phi\)) are derived from the
        integration of velocities (\(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\)), which in
        turn stem from the integration of accelerations (\(\ddot{x}, \ddot{y},
        \ddot{\phi}\)). These accelerations are calculated using Newton’s second
        law (\(F = ma\)) and the gravitational force (\(F_{g} = mg\)), with
        \(g\) being the gravitational constant \( 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2} \).
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ -\ddot{y} = \frac{F_{g} - F_{y}}{m} = F_{y} - g \qquad \ddot{x} =
        \frac{F_{x}}{m} \]
      </div>
      <p>
        The thrust components \(F_{x}\) and \(F_{y}\), acting along the x-axis
        and y-axis respectively, are computed using trigonometric relationships
        derived from the total thrust force (\(F_{total} = F_1 + F_2\)) and the
        orientation angle (\(\phi\)).
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ F_{y} = F_{total} \cos{\phi} \qquad F_{x} = F_{total} \sin{\phi} \]
      </div>

      <p>
        In drone dynamics, we employ two torque formulas (\(M_{x}\)), each with
        distinct historical and physical foundations. The first, \(M_{x} =
        F_{\phi} L\), originates from Archimedes' concept of leverage (circa
        287–212 BC), where \(F_{\phi} = F_{2} - F_{1}\) represents the force
        from the drone's rotors and \(L\) is the lever arm - the distance from
        the center of mass to the motors. This equation captures the rotational
        effect of force. The second, \(M_{x} = I_{x} \ddot{\phi}\), is grounded
        in Newton's laws of motion (circa 1687), linking torque (\(M_{x}\)) with
        the drone's moment of inertia (\(I_{x}\)) and angular acceleration
        (\(\ddot{\phi}\)). Together, these formulas allow us to determine the
        angular acceleration of the drone.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ M_{x} = F_{\phi}L \\ I_{x} \ddot{\phi} = (F_{2} - F_{1})L \\
        \ddot{\phi} = \frac{(F_{2} - F_{1}) L}{I_{x}} \]
      </div>

      <p>
        The state of the drone at time \( t + \Delta t \) is determined by the
        sum of its current state \( X_t \) and the integral of the state's time
        derivative \( \dot{X} \) over the interval \( \Delta t \). This integral
        represents a precise calculation of the state change. However, for
        computational simplicity, we often use an approximation method developed
        by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century (circa 1768). Euler's method
        approximates the future state by assuming a constant rate of change (\(
        \dot{X}_t \)) over a small interval (\( \Delta t \approx 0.01\)),
        simplifying the integral to a product of the rate of change and the time
        interval.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ X_{t + \Delta t} = X_{t} + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t} \dot{X}_{\tau} d\tau
        \approx X_t + \Delta t\dot{X}_t \]
      </div>

      <p>
        To fully and explicitly state the time evolution of the drone's state we
        substitute the equations for \(\ddot{x}\), \(\ddot{y}\), and
        \(\ddot{\phi}\) into the equation for \(X_{t + \Delta t}\).
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X_t + \Delta t \dot{X}_t= \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ \phi \\ \dot{x}
        \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{\phi} \end{bmatrix}_t + \Delta t \begin{bmatrix}
        \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ \dot{\phi} \\ \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \\ \ddot{\phi}
        \end{bmatrix}_t = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ \phi \\ \dot{x} \\ \dot{y}
        \\ \dot{\phi} \end{bmatrix}_t + \Delta t \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\
        \dot{y} \\ \dot{\phi} \\ \frac{\sin{\phi}(F_1 + F_2)}{m} \\ g -
        \cos{\phi}(F_1 + F_2) \\ \frac{L(F_{2} - F_{1})}{I_{x}} \end{bmatrix}_t
        \)
