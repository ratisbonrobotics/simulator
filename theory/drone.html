    <p><em>Abstract</em>—This document presents a comprehensive study on the
      two-dimensional and three-dimensional
      simulations of drone dynamics. It outlines the methodology for simulating the state and dynamics of drones in
      two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments, and discusses the determination of simulation parameters,
      including the experimental methods used. Theoretical models are established, and the results from the experiments
      are provided to better understand and predict the performance and behavior of drones under different operational
      conditions.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <section>
    <p>This document details the simulation of drone dynamics both in a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional space.
      The importance of accurate simulation lies in the potential for optimization of drone flight parameters for
      efficiency, agility, and stability. The paper outlines a framework for generating realistic dynamic behaviors and
      predicting the impact of design changes and environmental influences on flight performance.</p>
  </section>

  <h1>Two-Dimensional Simulation</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>State</h2>
    <p>A simulation is considered complete when it can predict the state \(X\) of the drone for the next discrete time
      segment.</p>
    <div class="equation">\( X = [x , y, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}] \)</div>
    <p>The state \(X\) consists of the coordinates on the y-axis, which points negatively towards the center of the
      Earth,
      the x-axis, and the vector \(\phi\), which describes the rotation angle about the x-axis. Additionally, the
      velocities, i.e., the rates of change, \(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\) of these quantities are also part of the
      vector.
      The thrust \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) of the two rotors, in combination with environmental influences, produce all
      forces
      that result in changes to the state vector \(X\).</p>

      </div>
    </figure>
    <p>The thrusts \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) are directed at an angle \(\phi\) to the y-axis. </p>

    <h2>Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Dynamics describe how the state \(X\) changes based on \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\). To work with fundamental
      quantities, \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) are expressed by their underlying rotor velocities \(\omega_{1}\) and
      \(\omega_{2}\). The relationship \(k_{f}\) between rotor velocity and force is quadratic as shown in
      <a href="#johansen2004">1</a>. Hence, we have:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">\( F_{i} = k_{f} \omega_{i}^2 \)</div>
    <p>This relationship \(k_{f}\) is determined empirically as explained in Chapter SimulationParameterDetermination.
      The changes in state in the positions \(x\), \(y\), and \(\phi\)
      result from the integration of the velocities \(\dot{z}, \dot{y}\), and \(\dot{\phi}\). The state changes of these
      result from the integration of the accelerations \(\ddot{x}, \ddot{y}\), and \(\ddot{\phi}\). These are derived
      from \(F = ma\) and the force of gravity \(F_{g} = mg\) with \(g = 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}\):
    </p>
    <div class="equation">\(-\ddot{y} = \frac{F_{g} - F_{y}}{m} = F_{y} - g \qquad \ddot{x} = \frac{F_{x}}{m}\)</div>
    <p>\(F_{x}\) is parallel to the x-axis, and \(F_{y}\) is parallel to the y-axis. Thus, there is a right angle
      between
      \(F_{z}\) and \(F_{y}\). Additionally, it holds true that
    </p>
    <div class="equation">\(F_{total} = \sum_{1}^{i} F_{i} = F_{1} + F_{2}\)</div>
    <p>The total force of both rotors \(F_{total}\) is oriented at an angle \(\phi\) to the y-axis.</p>
    <figure>
      <figcaption>Forces acting on a two-dimensional drone.</figcaption>
      <div style="border: 1px solid #000; margin-top: 6px; overflow: hidden;">
        <img src="2d_drone_forces.svg" alt="Forces on a 2D drone"
          style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; display: block; margin: auto;">
      </div>
    </figure>
    <p>Thus, the forces \(F_{x}\) and \(F_{y}\) result from the triangle's trigonometry as</p>
    <div class="equation">\(F_{y} = F_{total}\cos{\phi} \qquad F_{x} = F_{total}\sin{\phi}\)</div>
    <p>and the accelerations along the z- and y-axes by combining Equations 5, 6, and 7:</p>
    <div class="equation">\(\ddot{y} = \frac{(F_{1} + F_{2})\cos{\phi}}{m} - g \qquad \ddot{x} = \frac{(F_{1} +
      F_{2})\sin{\phi}}{m}\)</div>
    <p>\(\ddot{\phi}\) is derived through the combination of the equations for torque \(M\). \(l\) is the distance from
      the center of mass of the dual-rotor drone to one of the motors.</p>
    <div class="equation">\(M_{x} = F_{\phi} l \qquad M_{x} = I_{x} \ddot{\phi}\)</div>
    <p>The moment of inertia \(I_{x}\) has to be determined experimentally, as described in Chapter
      SimulationParameterDetermination. The force around the z-axis \(F_{\phi}\) is the difference in the
      two motor forces \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) from Figure Two-dimensional drone. A positive \(F_{\phi}\)
      corresponds to counter-clockwise rotation, and a negative value indicates clockwise rotation. In summary, we have:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">\(F_{\phi} = F_{2} - F_{1}\)</div>
    <p>Therefore, the angular acceleration \(\ddot{\phi}\) can be described as</p>
    <div class="equation">\(\ddot{\phi} = \frac{(F_{2} - F_{1}) \cdot l}{I_{x}}\)</div>
    <p>Hence, the dual-rotor drone's state at time \(t\) can be determined by the sum of the state \(X(t)\) and the
      integral of the time derivative of the state \(\dot{X}\).</p>
    <div class="equation">\(X(t + \Delta t) = X(t) + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\dot{X}(\tau) d\tau\)</div>
